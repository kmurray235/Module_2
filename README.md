# Defeat the Evil Wizard
---
The point of this project was to create a turn by turn battle between a character and a Wizard using classes, inheritance, and methods.

## Main_Menu function
This function starts the battle

## Picking a Character
This function asks the user to select a character class and name said character

## Battle function
This function allows the user to select which action it would like their character to do. They can choose everything between attacking the wizard to checking stats. After each action the wizard will attack and regenerate heath.

## End game
The game continues until either the character or the wizard is destoryed. A message is delived once the battle is over nameing the victory.
## Biggest Challenge
The biggest challenge of this program was making sure the health was decreased and increased at the right amound during the battle.

## What did I learn?
I learned that inheritance can be a great way to create multiple classes but also customize each child class for each warrior type.
